# Socket_Programming
Socket Programming Practice.

Practiced creating and binding sockets in Python by developing a variety of client-server programs. Implemented features ranging from basic connection setup to dynamic data handling. Projects included a factorial and prime number checker, a calculator, a palindrome validator, and string reversal. Emphasized real-time interaction by processing user inputs from the client side and generating responses on the server side.
